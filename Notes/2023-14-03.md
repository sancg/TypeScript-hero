## Best practices
If and interface required nested type-structures, it would had an athomic pattern, separeting each type according to its utility.
```typescript
/* You have a Product interface, but you want to introduce a category type*/
interface Product {
	id: string | number;
	title: string;
	size?: Sizes;
	// ‚ùå It has its own set of types, thus its better to separete the logic.
	category: {
		id: string | number;
		name: string;
	}
}

// ‚úÖ Good practice agter refactoring
interface Category {
	id: string | number;
	name: string;
}

interface Product {
	category: Category
}
```

## Inheritance | Extends 
When looking to refactor a `model | interface`, you should think about what those repeating types are and maybe take them out to be implemented separately. 
```typescript
interface BaseModel {
	readonly id: string | number; // ü§î HINT: It's not posible to overwrrite the ID.
	createdAt: Date;
	updatedAt: Date;
}

interface User extends BaseModel {
	username: string;
	password: string;
}
```
