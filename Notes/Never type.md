#### Never type
It helps to detect functions that never ends (infinite loops) or stops the program execution.
```typescript
const infiniteLoop = () => {
	while(true){
		console.log("Memory leak ðŸ˜‡")
	}
}
```
The returning value for this function would be `the type never`. Other example is when an Error is called and the program stops working.
