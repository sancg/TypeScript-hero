# Any

The Any operator is exclusive of _TypeScript_.

- Use cases goes from dealing with Unstructured libraries or migrations.
- Convert `Any` into an understanding type with the `as operator`:

```typescript
let foo: any;
foo = [2, 5, 10];

let newArray = foo as number[];
newArray = newArray.filter((item) => item > 3);
console.log({ newArray });
```
